ansible -i hosts all -m ping

1. Ansible picks the connections details from inventory file and does ssh on both
   ubuntu1 and ubuntu2 parallely.

2. Ansible creates a local temp directory in Ansible Controller Machine(ACM) and it creates
   a remote temp director at ~/.tmp

3. Ansible converts the ansible module ping.py into a plain python script in the local temp 
   folder.

4. Using sftp/scp tool, Ansible copies the transpiled ping.py script from local temp to
   remote temp on the Ansible node. It does this operation paralled on ubuntu1 and ubuntu2.

5. Ansible executes the ping.py on ubuntu1 and ubuntu2 using python available on the respective
   remote nodes.

6. Ansible grabs the output from the remote machines and cleans up the temp folder on the remote machines.

7. Finally Ansible gives a summary of responses in the Ansible Controller Machine(ACM).
